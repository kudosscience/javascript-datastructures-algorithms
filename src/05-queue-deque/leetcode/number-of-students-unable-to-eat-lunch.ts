// 1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch
// Easy

// hint 1: Simulate the process of giving sandwiches to students.
// hint 2: Calculate those who will eat instead of those who will not.

// Use two queues to simulate the process of giving sandwiches to students.

// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(n)

// Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
// Output: 0
console.log(countStudents([1,1,0,0], [0,1,0,1])); // 0
console.log(countStudents([1,1,1,0,0,1], [1,0,0,0,1,1])); // 3
