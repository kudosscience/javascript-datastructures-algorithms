# Project Structure

You can find the source code organized by chapter under the `src` folder.

*Each file has the `.js` and the `.ts` extension, so you get both the JavaScript and the Typescript versions of the source code.*

*Each data structure and algorithm from parts 2 and 3 also have a `_test_`* folder where you can find the respective `Jest` test cases.

## How to use this repository

**Install all dependencies**

```
npm install
```

**Run all tests**

```
npm test
```

**Run a particular example**

```
